# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-24-gdpr-compliance-features/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Mobile App Requirements

- **Privacy Settings Screen**: New React Native screen with granular privacy controls using AsyncStorage for persistence
- **GDPR Rights Interface**: Modal or screen allowing users to view, export, and delete their data with progress indicators
- **Consent Management System**: Enhanced signup flow with checkbox components and legal text display
- **EU User Detection**: IP-based or locale-based detection to trigger appropriate consent flows
- **Data Export Integration**: API calls to admin app endpoints returning JSON/CSV formatted user data
- **Privacy Policy Integration**: WebView or native text display with version tracking and consent logging

### Admin App Requirements

- **Enhanced Documentation System**: Structured data processing records with search and filtering capabilities
- **Automated Retention Policies**: Cron jobs or scheduled tasks for data purging based on configurable retention periods
- **Breach Notification Automation**: Alert system with 72-hour compliance tracking and authority notification workflows
- **Legal Basis Tracking**: Database schema additions to track legal basis for each data processing activity

### Integration Requirements

- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for data export, deletion requests, and consent preference updates
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Supabase realtime subscriptions for immediate consent preference updates
- **Audit Trail Enhancement**: Comprehensive logging of all GDPR-related activities with timestamps and user context

## Approach Options

**Option A: Phased Implementation**
- Pros: Reduced risk, easier testing, faster initial deployment
- Cons: Longer overall timeline, potential user confusion with partial features

**Option B: Complete Implementation** (Selected)
- Pros: Full compliance achieved at once, consistent user experience, clear launch milestone
- Cons: Higher complexity, more extensive testing required, longer initial development

**Option C: Mobile-First Implementation**
- Pros: User-facing features first, immediate privacy improvements
- Cons: Incomplete legal compliance, admin features lag behind user needs

**Rationale:** Option B selected because GDPR compliance is binary (compliant or non-compliant), and partial implementation still leaves legal vulnerability. Complete implementation ensures full regulatory protection and user trust.

## External Dependencies

**No new external libraries required** - leveraging existing infrastructure:
- **Supabase**: Already provides database, auth, and realtime capabilities needed for GDPR features
- **React Native**: Existing navigation and UI components sufficient for privacy interfaces
- **Next.js + shadcn/ui**: Admin app already has necessary UI components for enhanced documentation
- **Stripe**: Existing integration supports subscription management for privacy preferences

**Justification:** The existing tech stack provides all necessary capabilities for GDPR compliance implementation. Adding new dependencies would increase complexity and deployment risk without significant benefit.

## Performance Considerations

- **Data Export Operations**: Large user datasets may require background processing with progress indicators
- **EU User Detection**: IP geolocation lookup should be cached to avoid repeated API calls
- **Consent Preference Storage**: AsyncStorage for mobile, database for server-side synchronization
- **Audit Trail Storage**: Efficient indexing on timestamp and user ID fields for compliance reporting

## Security Requirements

- **Data Export Security**: Authenticated endpoints with rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Consent Validation**: Cryptographic signatures or timestamps to prove valid consent collection
- **Privacy Settings Encryption**: Sensitive preferences encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Admin Access Control**: Role-based permissions for GDPR administrative functions
