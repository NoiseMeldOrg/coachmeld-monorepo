# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: GDPR Compliance Features
> Created: 2025-07-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive GDPR legal compliance across both mobile and admin applications to achieve full regulatory compliance for EU users before v1.0.0 MVP launch. This builds upon existing technical infrastructure to add user-facing privacy controls, legal documentation, and complete compliance workflows.

## User Stories

### GDPR Rights Management

As a EU user, I want to easily access and exercise my GDPR rights (data export, deletion, correction) through the mobile app, so that I have full control over my personal data and can comply with my privacy preferences.

**Detailed Workflow**: User navigates to Settings → Privacy & Data → GDPR Rights, where they can view what data is collected, request data export in machine-readable format, request account deletion, or update their consent preferences. All requests integrate with existing admin app APIs for processing.

### Legal Compliance Documentation

As a business owner, I want comprehensive legal documentation and automated compliance processes, so that I can serve EU users without regulatory risk and maintain user trust through transparent data handling.

**Detailed Workflow**: Admin dashboard provides complete data processing records, retention policies, breach notification systems, and audit trails. Legal documentation is accessible to users through privacy policy and terms of service with clear consent collection throughout the user journey.

### Consent Management

As a EU user, I want granular control over what data is collected and how it's processed, so that I can use the app while maintaining my privacy preferences according to GDPR requirements.

**Detailed Workflow**: During signup and throughout app usage, users see clear consent options with legal basis explanations. Users can modify consent preferences in privacy settings, with changes synchronized across the platform and respected by all data processing activities.

## Spec Scope

1. **Mobile App User-Facing GDPR Features** - Complete privacy settings, data request flows, consent management, and rights exercise interfaces
2. **Admin App Legal Compliance Systems** - Enhanced documentation, breach notification, retention policies, and legal basis tracking
3. **Cross-App Integration** - Seamless API integration between mobile user requests and admin processing systems
4. **Legal Documentation Updates** - GDPR-compliant privacy policy, terms of service, and consent collection flows
5. **EU User Detection & Targeting** - System to identify EU users and provide appropriate consent flows and privacy controls

## Out of Scope

- Complete redesign of existing authentication flows (will enhance existing flows)
- Implementation of analytics or tracking systems (only consent management for future use)
- Multi-language translation of legal documents (English only for MVP)
- Advanced privacy analytics or user behavior tracking

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Mobile app provides complete GDPR user interface** allowing EU users to exercise all GDPR rights through intuitive in-app flows
2. **Admin app achieves full legal compliance documentation** with automated processes meeting all GDPR regulatory requirements
3. **Integrated system handles GDPR requests end-to-end** from mobile user interface through admin processing with complete audit trails
