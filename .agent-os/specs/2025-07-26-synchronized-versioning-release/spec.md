# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Synchronized Versioning & v0.9.0 Release
> Created: 2025-07-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement synchronized versioning across the CoachMeld monorepo and execute the v0.9.0 release, ensuring both mobile and admin apps share the same version number going forward while establishing a centralized version management system.

## User Stories

### Product Manager Release Story

As a product manager, I want to execute consistent releases across all CoachMeld applications, so that version numbers clearly communicate the feature set and maturity level of the entire platform rather than individual apps being out of sync.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Single command releases both mobile and admin apps simultaneously
- All apps share the same version number (e.g., v0.9.0)
- Version references in code automatically stay synchronized
- Release notes capture changes across the entire platform
- Git tags represent the entire monorepo state, not individual apps

### Developer Experience Story

As a developer working on the monorepo, I want version management to be automated and centralized, so that I never have to manually update version numbers in multiple places or worry about version drift between applications.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- All version numbers reference a single source of truth
- Release scripts handle updating versions everywhere they appear
- No hardcoded version strings scattered throughout the codebase
- Clear development workflow for patch, minor, and major releases

### User Communication Story

As a CoachMeld user, I want to understand what features are available across all my touchpoints (mobile app, admin interface), so that version numbers clearly communicate the platform's capabilities regardless of which app I'm using.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Mobile app shows v0.9.0 with progress tracking and GDPR compliance
- Admin dashboard shows v0.9.0 with corresponding backend features
- Documentation clearly maps version numbers to feature sets
- Support team can easily identify user's feature set from version number

## Spec Scope

1. **Centralized Version Management** - Single source of truth for version numbers in root package.json with automatic propagation to all apps
2. **Release Automation Scripts** - Command-line tools for executing synchronized releases with proper git tagging and changelog generation
3. **Version Reference Cleanup** - Replace all hardcoded version strings with dynamic references to the centralized version
4. **v0.9.0 Release Execution** - Update mobile app from v0.8.0, admin app from v0.3.0, and root from v1.0.0 to synchronized v0.9.0
5. **Documentation Updates** - Update all roadmaps, changelogs, and version references to reflect the new synchronized approach

## Out of Scope

- Automated deployment to app stores (will remain manual for v0.9.0)
- Version validation in CI/CD pipelines (future enhancement)
- Semantic versioning automation based on commit messages (future enhancement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Synchronized Version State** - All applications (mobile, admin, root) display and reference v0.9.0 consistently across all interfaces and documentation
2. **Release Management System** - Functional release scripts that can increment versions, update changelogs, create git tags, and generate release notes for the entire monorepo
3. **Clean Codebase** - No hardcoded version references remain; all version strings dynamically reference the centralized version source
