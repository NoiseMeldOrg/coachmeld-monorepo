## Dependencies

- **Technical Dependencies:**
  - Node.js scripts must be compatible with existing npm/yarn setup
  - Git operations must work with current repository structure
  - Version utilities must integrate with React Native and Next.js build systems
  - Release scripts must coordinate with existing deployment processes

- **Process Dependencies:**
  - Current development workflow should remain uninterrupted during implementation
  - Existing version references must be catalogued before replacement
  - Backup and rollback procedures must be tested before executing v0.9.0 release
  - Team must be trained on new release process before first synchronized release

- **External Dependencies:**
  - conventional-changelog-cli for automated changelog generation
  - semver package for version manipulation and validation
  - Git repository must be in clean state for release execution
  - Production deployment infrastructure must support new version format

## Risk Mitigation

- **Version Drift Risk:** Automated validation scripts and CI/CD checks prevent version inconsistencies
- **Release Failure Risk:** Comprehensive testing and rollback procedures ensure safe release execution
- **Performance Impact Risk:** Version access optimizations and caching prevent runtime performance degradation
- **Compatibility Risk:** Gradual migration and extensive testing ensure backward compatibility

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All applications consistently display v0.9.0 across all user interfaces
- [ ] Release process completes in under 30 seconds with full automation
- [ ] Version management scripts handle error scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Zero manual intervention required for routine version updates
- [ ] Complete elimination of hardcoded version references throughout codebase
- [ ] Git history remains clean with atomic version update commits
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects synchronized versioning approach
- [ ] CI/CD integration prevents version drift in future development
