- Test large monorepo scaling (future-proofing)

**Release Process Integration**

## Feature Tests

### User-Facing Version Display

**Mobile App Version Display**

- Test version consistency between frontend and backend
- Test version tracking in API logs
- Test version-based feature flags (if implemented)

### Release Process Validation

**Pre-Release Validation**
- Test clean working directory requirement
- Test correct branch validation
- Test version format validation
- Test duplicate version prevention

**Post-Release Validation**
- Test all applications report correct version
- Test git tag creation and format
- Test changelog generation completeness
- Test deployment readiness indicators

## Mocking Requirements

### File System Operations
- **Mock fs.readFileSync** - Test package.json reading with various file states
- **Mock fs.writeFileSync** - Test package.json writing without actual file changes
- **Mock file permissions** - Test behavior when files are read-only or inaccessible

### Git Operations
- **Mock execSync for git commands** - Test git operations without affecting actual repository
- **Mock git status responses** - Test various working directory states
- **Mock git branch responses** - Test branch validation logic

### Network Operations  
- **Mock changelog generation** - Test without external dependencies
- **Mock npm registry checks** - Test version availability validation
- **Mock deployment APIs** - Test integration with deployment platforms

## End-to-End Test Scenarios

### Complete Release Workflow

**Scenario: First Synchronized Release (v0.9.0)**
1. Start with mismatched versions (Mobile: 0.8.0, Admin: 0.3.0, Root: 1.0.0)
2. Execute release script with target version 0.9.0
3. Validate all package.json files updated to 0.9.0
4. Validate all hardcoded references updated
5. Validate git commit and tag created correctly
6. Validate applications display v0.9.0 in UI
7. Validate changelogs generated for all apps

**Scenario: Subsequent Release (v0.9.1)**
1. Start with synchronized v0.9.0 across all apps
2. Execute patch release to v0.9.1
3. Validate incremental updates work correctly
4. Validate changelog appends new version
5. Validate no regression in version display

**Scenario: Emergency Rollback**
1. Detect critical issue in v0.9.0 release
2. Execute rollback procedures
3. Validate all apps return to previous stable version
4. Validate git history remains clean
5. Validate version displays reflect rollback

### Error Recovery Testing

**Scenario: Partial Update Failure**
1. Simulate failure during version sync (e.g., file permission error)
2. Validate system detects incomplete state
3. Execute recovery procedures
4. Validate all apps reach consistent state

**Scenario: Git Operation Failure**
1. Simulate git tag creation failure
2. Validate system handles git errors gracefully
3. Validate version updates are reversed if git fails
4. Validate clean recovery path exists

## Performance Tests

### Release Script Performance
- **Target**: Complete release process in < 30 seconds
- **Measurement**: Time from script start to git tag creation
- **Validation**: No performance regression with additional apps

### Version Access Performance
- **Target**: Version retrieval in < 1ms for UI display
- **Measurement**: Time to import and access version in components
- **Validation**: No impact on application startup time

### File Operation Performance
- **Target**: Version sync across 10+ apps in < 5 seconds
- **Measurement**: Time to read, update, and write all package.json files
- **Validation**: Scalability for future monorepo growth

## Automated Test Execution

### CI/CD Integration Tests
```yaml
# Test workflow for version consistency
name: Version Sync Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test-version-sync:
    steps:
      - name: Test version check script
        run: npm run test:version-check
      - name: Test version sync script  
        run: npm run test:version-sync
      - name: Test release script (dry run)
        run: npm run test:release -- --dry-run
```

### Pre-commit Test Requirements
- Version consistency validation must pass
- Unit tests for version utilities must pass
- Integration tests for critical paths must pass
- Performance benchmarks must not regress
