# N8N Removal Summary

**Status: COMPLETE (as of June 2025)**

This document summarizes the removal of N8N from the CoachMeld codebase. All references to n8n have been removed in favor of a RAG-based system.

## What was N8N used for?

N8N was originally planned as a webhook service to:
- Receive coach chat requests from the app
- Forward them to an AI provider (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)
- Return the AI response to the app

## What was removed?

### 1. Environment Variables
- Removed `EXPO_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` from `.env` and `.env.example`

### 2. Type Definitions
- Removed `n8nWebhookUrl?: string` from the Coach interface in `src/types/index.ts`

### 3. Database Schema
- Removed `n8n_webhook_url` column from coaches table in migration 002
- Updated comment in `schema.sql` from "tracking n8n webhooks" to "tracking AI API calls"

### 4. Supabase Edge Function
- Deleted `supabase/functions/ai-coach-webhook/` directory entirely

### 5. Documentation
- Updated `supabase/README.md` to remove N8N setup instructions
- Replaced with Gemini API integration instructions

## What replaces N8N?

The app now uses **Gemini API directly** for:
1. **Chat Responses**: Will call Gemini API from the app or a simplified edge function
2. **RAG Embeddings**: Already implemented in `scripts/gemini-embeddings.js`
3. **Document Search**: Vector similarity search with pgvector

## Benefits of removing N8N

1. **Simpler Architecture**: One less service to maintain
2. **Lower Latency**: Direct API calls without webhook middleman
3. **Cost Savings**: No need to host N8N instance
4. **Easier Development**: Everything in one codebase

## Next Steps

To complete the AI integration:
1. Create a Gemini chat service similar to the embedding service
2. Update `aiCoach.ts` to use real Gemini API calls
3. Optionally create a Supabase edge function for API key security

The architecture is now cleaner and ready for direct Gemini integration!
