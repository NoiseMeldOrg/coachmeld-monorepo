## AI Integration

The app uses Google's Gemini API for:

## Email Confirmation

### Development Setup
For development, you can disable email confirmation:
1. Go to Authentication > Providers > Email in Supabase dashboard
2. Turn OFF "Confirm email"
3. Users can now sign up and immediately access the app

### Production Setup
For production environments:
1. Keep email confirmation enabled
2. Set proper redirect URLs in Authentication > URL Configuration
3. Configure email templates in Authentication > Email Templates
4. The app handles confirmation with user-friendly messages

### How Email Confirmation Works
1. User signs up â†’ Receives confirmation email
2. Email contains link with redirect to app origin
3. After confirmation, user can sign in normally
4. If user tries to sign in before confirming, they see a helpful message

- All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Users can only access their own data
- Edge function uses service role key for database operations
- Email confirmation adds an extra layer of account verification
