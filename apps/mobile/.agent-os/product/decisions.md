### Decision

Implement comprehensive GDPR legal compliance in mobile app v0.9.0, prioritizing user-facing privacy controls, consent management, and data subject rights as MVP-blocking requirements.

### Context

As a US-based solo developer serving EU users, GDPR compliance is legally mandatory regardless of business location. While the admin app already implements sophisticated technical deletion systems, the mobile app needs user-facing GDPR features to achieve complete legal compliance before v1.0.0 launch.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Technical Compliance Only** (Current State)
   - Pros: Already implemented, minimal additional work
   - Cons: Legal vulnerability, potential fines up to €20M or 4% revenue, incomplete compliance

   - Cons: High cost for solo developer ($10K+ annually), loss of control, integration complexity

3. **Minimal Compliance Approach**
   - Pros: Lower effort, faster to market
   - Cons: High risk of non-compliance, regulatory scrutiny, user trust issues

### Rationale

Complete GDPR compliance protects the business from significant legal and financial risks while building user trust in privacy-conscious markets. The technical foundation (deletion APIs, audit trails) is already sophisticated, making user-facing compliance features a logical extension that provides outsized risk reduction for the development effort required.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Legal protection from GDPR violations and potential €20M fines
- Increased user trust and confidence in data handling
- Competitive advantage in privacy-conscious European markets
- Foundation for international expansion and enterprise sales
- Clear data governance practices and user rights fulfillment
- Integration with already-implemented admin app GDPR backend

**Negative:**
- Additional 2-3 weeks development time before MVP launch
- Ongoing compliance maintenance and documentation overhead
- Need for legal review of privacy policies and terms
- Coordination complexity between mobile and admin app implementations
- User experience complexity with consent flows and privacy settings

## 2025-07-24: Next.js Web Application Strategy

**ID:** DEC-008
**Status:** Planned
**Category:** Technical/Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Build a separate Next.js web application for CoachMeld instead of fixing React Native Web compatibility issues, prioritizing web-optimized performance and user experience.

### Context

After extensive debugging of React Native Web deployment issues (React hooks dispatcher conflicts, bundle size concerns), it became clear that mobile and web users have different needs and expectations. The mobile app (v0.8.0) is mature and optimized for mobile coaching experiences, while web users need marketing-focused content and desktop-optimized interfaces.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Fix React Native Web Issues**
   - Pros: Single codebase, shared components and logic, faster feature development
   - Cons: Web performance limitations, mobile-first design not optimal for desktop, ongoing compatibility issues, limited web-specific features (SEO, SSR)

2. **Simple Landing Page**
   - Pros: Quick to implement, minimal maintenance
   - Cons: Missed business opportunities, no web coaching functionality, limited user engagement

3. **Separate Next.js Web App** (Selected)
   - Pros: Web-optimized performance, better SEO for discovery, desktop-friendly UI, web-native features, professional web experience, marketing potential
   - Cons: Maintain two codebases, more development time for new features, need to sync data models

### Rationale

The mobile app is mature and doesn't require frequent UI changes. Different user intentions exist: mobile users want full coaching experience, web users often want to learn about the product first. A Next.js web app enables SEO, marketing, and enterprise sales while leveraging existing Supabase backend and Stripe web integration.
