## The Problem

### Expensive and Inaccessible Health Coaching

Traditional health coaching costs $150-500 per session, making it inaccessible to most people. Additionally, coaches aren't available 24/7 when you need immediate guidance or motivation.

**Our Solution:** AI-powered coaches available anytime for $9.99/month, providing instant, personalized responses based on your profile and goals.

### Information Overload and Conflicting Advice

The internet is full of contradictory health information, making it difficult to know what advice to follow. Different diets work for different people, but finding the right approach is overwhelming.

**Our Solution:** Six specialized diet coaches (Carnivore, Paleo, Keto, Ketovore, Low Carb, Lion) with curated, evidence-based knowledge powered by RAG technology.

### Lack of Personalized Meal Planning

Generic meal plans don't account for individual preferences, restrictions, or goals. Most apps provide one-size-fits-all solutions that users abandon quickly.

**Our Solution:** Dynamic meal planning system that generates personalized recipes based on your chosen diet, preferences, and health goals.

## Differentiators

### Multi-Coach Specialization System

Unlike generic AI assistants, we provide six specialized diet coaches, each with deep expertise in their specific approach. This allows users to find the diet philosophy that resonates with them rather than getting generic nutrition advice.

### RAG-Powered Knowledge Base

Our coaches are powered by a sophisticated Retrieval Augmented Generation system with curated content from certified professionals. This results in accurate, evidence-based responses rather than generic AI-generated content.

### Privacy-First Architecture

We prioritize user privacy with GDPR compliance, data export capabilities, and secure data handling. Unlike many health apps that sell user data, we maintain strict privacy standards and transparent data practices.
