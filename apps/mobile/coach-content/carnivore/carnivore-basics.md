# Carnivore Diet Basics Guide

## Core Principles

1. **Animal Products Only**: The foundation of the diet is animal-based foods
2. **Zero Carbohydrates**: By eliminating plants, carbohydrate intake approaches zero
3. **High Protein and Fat**: Macronutrients come primarily from protein and fat
4. **Nutrient Density**: Focus on nutrient-dense organ meats and fatty cuts

## Foods Included
