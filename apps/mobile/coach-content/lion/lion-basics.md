# Lion Diet Basics Guide

## What is the Lion Diet?

The Lion Diet is the most restrictive form of carnivore eating, consisting of only ruminant meat (beef, lamb, bison), salt, and water. Developed as an elimination protocol, it's designed to identify food sensitivities and reduce inflammation to the absolute minimum.

## Core Principles

1. **Ruminant Meat Only**: Beef, lamb, bison, venison
2. **Salt and Water**: The only additions allowed
3. **Elimination Protocol**: Remove all potential triggers
4. **Healing Focus**: Designed for therapeutic purposes

## The Rules

### Allowed
- **Beef** - All cuts, ground beef, organs
- **Lamb** - All cuts including mutton
- **Bison** - If available
- **Other Ruminants** - Venison, elk, goat
- **Salt** - Unrefined sea salt or pink salt
- **Water** - Filtered or spring water

### Not Allowed
- Pork, chicken, turkey, or any non-ruminant meat
- Fish or seafood
- Eggs
- Dairy (including butter)
- Seasonings or spices (except salt)
- Coffee, tea, or any beverages except water
- Any plant foods whatsoever

## Why So Restrictive?

The Lion Diet serves as the ultimate elimination diet for:
- Severe autoimmune conditions
- Chronic digestive issues
- Unexplained inflammation
- Mental health concerns
- Skin conditions
- When other approaches haven't worked

## Getting Started

### Preparation Phase
- Clear out non-Lion foods
- Stock up on quality ruminant meats
- Get different cuts for variety
- Prepare mentally for the restriction

### Week 1-2: Adjustment
- Expect significant changes
- Increase salt intake substantially
- Drink water liberally
- Keep meals simple

### Week 3-4: Adaptation
- Energy may fluctuate
- Digestive changes are normal
- Cravings will diminish
- Focus on healing

### Month 2-3: Stabilization
- Most report feeling better
- Symptoms often improve
- Energy stabilizes
- Consider tracking improvements

## Implementation Guidelines

### Meat Selection
- **Fatty Cuts**: Ribeye, chuck roast, lamb shoulder
- **Ground Meat**: 70/30 or 80/20 for adequate fat
- **Organs**: Liver, heart, kidney (if desired)
- **Bone Broth**: Made from bones and water only

### Meal Structure
- 2-3 meals per day
- Eat to satiety
- No need to track macros
- Let hunger guide you

### Salt Requirements
- Much higher than standard diets
- 2-4 teaspoons daily
- Salt meat liberally
- Listen to salt cravings

## Sample Daily Eating

### Option 1
- **Morning**: 1 lb ground beef with salt
- **Evening**: 12 oz ribeye with salt

### Option 2
- **Meal 1**: 10 oz lamb chops
- **Meal 2**: 8 oz beef liver (once weekly)
- **Meal 3**: 1 lb ground beef

### Option 3
- **OMAD** (One Meal): 2 lbs mixed ruminant meats

## Common Experiences

### First Month
- Rapid water weight loss
- Possible fatigue or "adaptation flu"
- Digestive changes
- Improved mental clarity
- Reduced inflammation

### Months 2-3
- Stable energy
- Better sleep
- Skin improvements
- Mood stabilization
- Symptom reduction

## Reintroduction Protocol

After 30-90 days, you may test foods:

### Phase 1: Animal Foods
- Week 1: Add eggs
- Week 2: Add pork
- Week 3: Add chicken/poultry
- Week 4: Add fish

### Phase 2: Dairy (Optional)
- Week 5: Hard cheese
- Week 6: Butter
- Week 7: Heavy cream

### Phase 3: Plants (If Desired)
- One food at a time
- Wait 3-4 days between
- Journal all reactions

## Important Considerations

**Medical Supervision**: Critical for those with health conditions

**Supplement Needs**: Most find they need only salt, but monitor

**Social Challenges**: This diet is extremely restrictive socially

**Not for Everyone**: This is a therapeutic intervention, not necessarily long-term

## Troubleshooting

### Fatigue
- Increase fat intake (fattier cuts)
- More salt
- Ensure adequate calories
- Be patient

### Constipation
- More fat
- Adequate water
- Movement/walking
- Magnesium if needed

### Persistent Issues
- Check meat quality
- Ensure true Lion Diet compliance
- Consider histamine issues
- Seek professional guidance

## Who Might Benefit?

- Severe autoimmune conditions
- IBD/IBS that hasn't responded to other approaches
- Chronic fatigue syndrome
- Depression/anxiety (as part of comprehensive treatment)
- Severe food sensitivities
- As a reset before reintroduction

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should I do the Lion Diet?
Minimum 30 days for elimination purposes, many do 60-90 days for full benefits.

### Will I get scurvy without vitamin C?
Fresh meat contains vitamin C, and requirements decrease on zero-carb diets.

### Can I exercise?
Yes, but expect reduced performance initially. Listen to your body.

### Is this sustainable long-term?
Some maintain it for years, others use it as a healing phase. Individual choice.

### What if I can't afford grass-fed?
Grain-fed is fine; the elimination aspect is more important than perfection.

## Signs It's Working

- Reduced inflammation
- Better digestion
- Clearer thinking
- Improved energy
- Better sleep
- Symptom improvement

## When to Stop or Modify

- If health worsens after adequate adaptation
- Once healing goals are met
- Under medical advisement
- Personal preference

## Conclusion

The Lion Diet represents the ultimate elimination protocol - a temporary therapeutic intervention for those who need extreme dietary restriction to heal. While highly restrictive, many find it provides clarity about food sensitivities and a foundation for rebuilding their diet. Always work with healthcare providers when undertaking such a restrictive protocol, and remember: this is a tool for healing, not necessarily a lifetime prescription.
