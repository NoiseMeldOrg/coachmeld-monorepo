# Ketovore Diet Basics Guide

## What is the Ketovore Diet?

The Ketovore diet is a hybrid approach combining the metabolic benefits of ketosis with the simplicity of carnivore eating. It's primarily animal-based while allowing select low-carb plant foods, making it more flexible than strict carnivore but more focused than standard keto.

## Core Principles

1. **Animal-Based Foundation**: 80-90% of calories from animal products
2. **Selective Plant Foods**: Only low-carb, low-toxin plants
3. **Ketogenic Macros**: Maintaining ketosis through very low carbs
4. **Nutrient Density**: Emphasis on nose-to-tail eating

## Food Hierarchy

### Tier 1 - Foundation (80-90%)
- **Ruminant Meats** - Beef, lamb, bison, venison
- **Other Meats** - Pork, poultry, game
- **Fish & Seafood** - Fatty fish, shellfish
- **Eggs** - Whole eggs from any source
- **Animal Fats** - Tallow, lard, duck fat, butter

### Tier 2 - Allowed Plants (10-20%)
- **Low-Carb Vegetables** - Leafy greens, cucumbers, zucchini
- **Cruciferous** - Broccoli, cauliflower (if tolerated)
- **Avocados** - Technically a fruit but keto-friendly
- **Olives** - Another fatty fruit exception
- **Select Seasonings** - Herbs, spices in moderation

### Tier 3 - Optional Additions
- **Hard Cheeses** - If well-tolerated
- **Heavy Cream** - Small amounts
- **Macadamia Nuts** - Lowest carb nut option

## Foods to Avoid

- **All Grains** - Even "keto-friendly" alternatives
- **Legumes** - Including peanuts
- **Nightshades** - Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant
- **High-FODMAP Vegetables** - Onions, garlic
- **Fruits** - Except avocados and olives
- **Processed Foods** - Even if labeled "keto"

## Macro Guidelines

- **Fat**: 70-80% of calories
- **Protein**: 20-25% of calories
- **Carbs**: 5-10% (typically under 20g)

Focus on fatty cuts of meat to naturally achieve these ratios.

## Getting Started

### Week 1-2: Transition
- Start with carnivore base
- Add one plant food at a time
- Monitor reactions and ketone levels
- Focus on fat adaptation

### Week 3-4: Optimization
- Find your plant food tolerance
- Establish meal patterns
- Track what makes you feel best
- Build your personal template

## Sample Daily Menu

### Breakfast
- 3 eggs cooked in tallow
- 4 oz ground beef (80/20)
- Small side of saut√©ed spinach

### Lunch
- 8 oz ribeye steak
- Mixed greens with olive oil

## Why Choose Ketovore?

**vs. Carnivore**:
- More variety and flexibility
- Easier social situations
- Additional micronutrients
- Better for some digestive systems

**vs. Standard Keto**:
- Simpler food choices
- Less tracking needed
- Fewer processed foods
- Better satiety

## Implementation Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin mostly carnivore, add plants gradually
2. **Quality Matters**: Grass-fed, organic when possible
3. **Listen to Your Body**: Remove foods that cause issues
4. **Don't Force Plants**: If you feel better without them, go full carnivore
5. **Track Initially**: Monitor ketones and how foods affect you

## Common Patterns

### Athletic Ketovore
- Higher protein (25-30%)
- Strategic plant foods around training
- May include small amounts of berries

### Healing Ketovore
- More restrictive plant selection
- Focus on gut-healing foods
- May exclude dairy completely

### Relaxed Ketovore
- Wider variety of low-carb vegetables
- Occasional keto treats
- More dining flexibility

## Troubleshooting

**Digestive Issues?**
- Reduce fiber/plants
- Try different vegetables
- Consider digestive enzymes
- Go more carnivore

**Not in Ketosis?**
- Check vegetable portions
- Reduce protein slightly
- Increase fat intake
- Eliminate hidden carbs

**Low Energy?**
- Increase salt intake
- Add more fat
- Check electrolytes
- Be patient with adaptation

## Benefits Often Reported

- Stable ketosis with more variety
- Improved digestion vs. standard keto
- Better micronutrient profile than carnivore
- Reduced inflammation
- Mental clarity
- Sustainable long-term approach

## Important Considerations

**Individual Tolerance**: Plant foods affect everyone differently

**Seasonal Eating**: Consider varying plant intake with seasons

**Preparation Methods**: How you cook vegetables matters

**Bio-Individuality**: Your optimal mix is unique to you

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many vegetables should I eat?
Start small (1-2 servings) and adjust based on how you feel and ketone levels.

### Can I do Ketovore without tracking?
Yes, the animal-based focus naturally keeps carbs low for most people.

### What if vegetables make me bloated?
Reduce amount, try different types, or go full carnivore temporarily.

### Is Ketovore good for weight loss?
Yes, it combines the benefits of ketosis with high satiety from animal foods.

### Can I switch between Carnivore and Ketovore?

## Conclusion

Ketovore offers a practical middle ground between the therapeutic simplicity of carnivore and the flexibility of standard keto. It's ideal for those who want the benefits of an animal-based diet while maintaining some plant variety. Remember, the best diet is the one that makes YOU feel optimal - use Ketovore as a template and adjust to your needs.
