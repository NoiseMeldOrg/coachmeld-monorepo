# Paleo Diet Basics Guide

## What is the Paleo Diet?

The Paleo diet, also known as the Paleolithic or "caveman" diet, is based on foods that our hunter-gatherer ancestors would have eaten during the Paleolithic era. The diet focuses on whole, unprocessed foods while eliminating modern processed foods, grains, and dairy.

## Core Principles

1. **Whole Foods Only**: Focus on unprocessed, natural foods
2. **No Grains or Legumes**: Eliminate foods that require extensive processing
