# Keto Diet Basics Guide

## What is the Ketogenic Diet?

The ketogenic (keto) diet is a very low carbohydrate, high fat diet that shifts your body's primary fuel source from glucose to ketones. By drastically reducing carbs and replacing them with fat, your body enters a metabolic state called ketosis.

## Core Principles

1. **Very Low Carb**: Typically under 20-30g net carbs daily
2. **High Fat**: 70-80% of total calories
3. **Moderate Protein**: 15-25% of total calories
4. **Metabolic Shift**: Transition from glucose to fat burning

## Macronutrient Breakdown

Standard Ketogenic Diet (SKD):
- **Fat**: 70-80%
- **Protein**: 15-25%
- **Carbs**: 5-10%

Example for 2000 calories:
- Fat: 155-178g
- Protein: 75-125g
- Carbs: 20-30g

## Foods to Emphasize

- **Healthy Fats** - Avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, butter, MCT oil
- **Fatty Proteins** - Ribeye, salmon, eggs, bacon, dark meat chicken
- **Low-Carb Vegetables** - Spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini
- **Nuts & Seeds** - Macadamias, pecans, chia seeds, flaxseeds
- **Full-Fat Dairy** - Heavy cream, cheese, full-fat Greek yogurt
- **Low-Carb Fruits** - Avocados, olives, small portions of berries

## Foods to Avoid

- **All Grains** - Wheat, rice, oats, corn, quinoa
- **Sugar** - All forms including honey and maple syrup
- **Starchy Vegetables** - Potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots
- **Most Fruits** - Except small portions of berries
- **Legumes** - Beans, lentils, chickpeas
- **High-Carb Condiments** - Ketchup, BBQ sauce, sweet dressings

## Getting Into Ketosis

### Week 1: Strict Induction
- Limit to 20g net carbs
- Increase salt intake (5-7g daily)
- Hydrate extensively
- Expect "keto flu" symptoms

### Week 2-3: Adaptation
- Energy may fluctuate
- Continue strict carb limit
- Monitor ketones if desired
- Focus on electrolytes

### Week 4+: Fat Adapted
- Energy stabilizes
- Hunger decreases
- Mental clarity improves
- Can adjust macros slightly

## Measuring Ketosis

**Blood Ketones**: 0.5-3.0 mmol/L (optimal: 1.5-3.0)
**Urine Strips**: Less accurate over time
**Breath Meters**: Convenient but variable

## Sample Daily Menu

### Breakfast
- 3 eggs scrambled in butter
- 2 strips bacon
- 1/2 avocado
- Black coffee with MCT oil

### Lunch
- Cobb salad with ranch dressing
- Grilled chicken thigh
- Bacon, blue cheese, hard-boiled egg

### Dinner
- Ribeye steak (8 oz)
- Asparagus with hollandaise
- Side of saut√©ed spinach

### Snacks/Fat Bombs
- Macadamia nuts
- Cheese crisps
- Celery with almond butter

## The Keto Flu

Common symptoms during transition:
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Irritability
- Constipation
- Bad breath
- Muscle cramps

**Prevention/Treatment**:
- Increase sodium (broth, pickle juice)
- Supplement magnesium and potassium
- Stay hydrated
- Get adequate sleep
- Consider gradual transition

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too much protein**: Can kick you out of ketosis
2. **Not enough fat**: Leading to hunger and low energy
3. **Hidden carbs**: Check all labels and condiments
4. **Neglecting vegetables**: Important for nutrients and fiber
5. **Inadequate electrolytes**: Critical for feeling good

## Benefits Often Reported

- Rapid weight loss (initial water weight)
- Reduced appetite
- Mental clarity and focus
- Stable energy levels
- Improved insulin sensitivity
- Reduced inflammation
- Better sleep quality

## Important Considerations

**Medical Supervision**: Essential if you have diabetes or take medications

**Nutrient Density**: Focus on whole foods, not just macros

**Social Challenges**: Plan for dining out and social events

**Individual Variation**: Some thrive, others don't - listen to your body

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to get into ketosis?
Typically 2-4 days of strict carb restriction, but can vary.

### Can I have cheat days?
They will kick you out of ketosis and require re-adaptation.

### What about cholesterol?
Most see improvements in HDL and triglycerides; LDL response varies.

### Is keto safe long-term?
Many follow it for years, but long-term studies are limited.

### Can I exercise on keto?
Yes, but expect reduced performance initially. Consider targeted/cyclical keto for intense training.

## Troubleshooting

**Not losing weight?**
- Check hidden carbs
- Monitor calories
- Assess dairy intake
- Consider intermittent fasting

**Low energy?**
- Increase fat intake
- Check electrolytes
- Ensure adequate calories
- Be patient with adaptation

## Conclusion

The ketogenic diet is a powerful metabolic tool that can provide significant benefits for many people. Success requires careful attention to macronutrients, adequate preparation, and patience during the adaptation period. Always consult with healthcare providers before making dramatic dietary changes.
