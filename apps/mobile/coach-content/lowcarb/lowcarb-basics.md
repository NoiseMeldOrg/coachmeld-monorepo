# Low Carb Diet Basics Guide

## What is a Low Carb Diet?

A low carb diet restricts carbohydrate intake, typically to less than 100-150 grams per day, while emphasizing proteins and healthy fats. Unlike strict ketogenic diets, low carb allows more flexibility while still providing metabolic benefits.

## Core Principles

1. **Reduced Carbohydrates**: Limit to 50-150g daily depending on goals
2. **Moderate Protein**: 0.8-1.2g per pound of lean body mass
3. **Healthy Fats**: Fill remaining calories with quality fats
4. **Whole Foods Focus**: Minimize processed foods

## Carbohydrate Ranges

- **Very Low Carb**: Under 50g/day (may induce ketosis)
- **Low Carb**: 50-100g/day (typical target)
- **Moderate Low Carb**: 100-150g/day (maintenance)

## Foods to Emphasize

- **Proteins** - Beef, chicken, fish, eggs, pork, turkey
- **Non-Starchy Vegetables** - Leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini
- **Healthy Fats** - Olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, butter
- **Low-Sugar Fruits** - Berries, avocados, olives
- **Dairy** - Cheese, Greek yogurt, heavy cream
- **Nuts & Seeds** - Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds

## Foods to Limit or Avoid

- **Grains** - Bread, pasta, rice, cereal
- **Sugary Foods** - Candy, cookies, cakes, soda
