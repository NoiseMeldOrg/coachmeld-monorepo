      category: 'Lion Diet Basics',
      content: `The Lion Diet is the ultimate elimination diet: only ruminant meat (beef, lamb, bison), 
      salt, and water. Created by Mikhaila Peterson for severe autoimmune issues. This extreme approach 
      removes all potential dietary triggers, allowing the body to heal and reset. Typically followed 
      for 30-90 days minimum before any reintroductions.`

    {
      category: 'Why So Restrictive',
      content: `Ruminant meat is the most hypoallergenic food - single-stomach animals on natural diets. 
      Eliminates: all plant foods, dairy, eggs, pork, chicken, seafood, and seasonings except salt. 
      This gives the immune system complete rest from potential triggers while providing essential nutrition.`

      category: 'Implementation Guide',
      content: `Week 1-2: Transition period, may feel worse before better (die-off reactions)
      Week 3-4: Symptoms often begin improving dramatically
      Month 2-3: Significant healing reported by most
      Month 3+: Consider careful reintroductions if desired
      Commit fully - even small cheats can restart inflammatory processes.`

    {
      category: 'Meat Selection',
      content: `Best choices: Grass-fed beef, lamb, bison - fattier cuts preferred
      Acceptable: Grain-fed if grass-fed unavailable, ground beef, steaks, roasts
      Preparation: Salt only, cook to preference, many do well with rare to medium
      Quantity: Eat to satiety, typically 1.5-3 lbs daily, listen to hunger`

      category: 'Healing Timeline',
      content: `Days 1-7: Adaptation, possible fatigue, digestive changes
      Week 2-3: Die-off symptoms may occur (temporary worsening)
      Week 4-6: Energy improving, inflammation reducing, mental clarity
      Month 2-3: Significant improvements in autoimmune symptoms
      Month 3+: Continued healing, consider reintroduction protocol`

    {
      category: 'Salt and Hydration',
      content: `Salt is crucial - use liberally, 5-10g daily common. Unrefined salt (Redmond Real Salt) 
      preferred by many. Water needs may change - drink to thirst, don't force. Some add electrolytes 
      but purists stick to salt only. Adequate sodium prevents fatigue and headaches.`

      category: 'Common Experiences',
      content: `Positive: Autoimmune symptom relief, mental health improvements, skin clearing, 
      joint pain resolution, digestive healing, stable mood, amazing energy
      Challenges: Social difficulties, initial boredom, adaptation symptoms, 
      requires commitment and patience`

    {
      category: 'Fat to Protein Balance',
      content: `Crucial to get enough fat - choose ribeye, chuck, 80/20 ground beef. 
      Too lean causes rabbit starvation symptoms. Add tallow if needed. 
      Many thrive on 70-80% fat, 20-30% protein by calories. Listen to your body's needs.`

    {
      category: 'Reintroduction Protocol',
      content: `After 90+ days, reintroduce one food every 4-7 days:
      Start with: Egg yolks, then whites, then together
      Next: Other meats (pork, chicken, seafood)
      Then: Dairy (butter, cream, cheese)
      Last: Any plant foods
      Journal all reactions carefully.`

    {
      category: 'Who Benefits Most',
      content: `Particularly effective for: Autoimmune conditions (RA, psoriasis, Crohn's, UC), 
      severe mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar), chronic fatigue, 
      unexplained symptoms, those who've "tried everything else."`

    {
      category: 'Sustainability Considerations',
      content: `Lion Diet often temporary healing protocol, not necessarily forever. 
      Many transition to regular carnivore or ketovore after healing. 
      Some maintain lion diet long-term if it's what keeps symptoms at bay. 
      Quality of life improvement makes restrictions worthwhile for many.`

    {
      category: 'Practical Tips',
      content: `Meal prep: Cook in bulk, freeze portions
      Travel: Call ahead to restaurants, bring own food if needed
      Social: Eat before events, be confident in your healing choice
      Variety: Different cuts, cooking methods, temperatures keep it interesting
      Support: Find online communities for encouragement`

  commonQuestions: [
    {
      question: "Isn't eating only meat dangerous?",
      answer: "Ruminant meat is nutritionally complete. Many thrive on it for months or years. Work with a knowledgeable practitioner and get blood work. The healing benefits often outweigh concerns."
    },
    {
      question: "What about vitamin C?",
      answer: "Fresh meat contains vitamin C, and requirements are lower without carbs. No recorded cases of scurvy on fresh meat diets. Grass-fed meat has more vitamin C than grain-fed."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I handle the boredom?",
      answer: "Focus on healing, not entertainment from food. Vary cuts and cooking methods. Remember it's temporary for most. The dramatic health improvements make it worthwhile."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I have coffee or tea?",
      answer: "Strict lion diet says no - only water. Some include black coffee after healing phase. Test your individual tolerance. Many find they don't need caffeine with stable energy."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I can't afford grass-fed?",
      answer: "Grain-fed is fine - still provides healing benefits. Buy in bulk, choose fattier ground beef, look for sales. The healing is worth the investment if possible."
