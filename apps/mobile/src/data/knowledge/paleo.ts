      category: 'Paleo Philosophy',
      content: `The Paleo diet mimics our ancestors' eating patterns before agriculture. Focus on whole, 
      unprocessed foods: meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds. Eliminate grains, legumes, 
      dairy, and processed foods. This isn't about historical reenactment but eating foods our bodies 
      evolved to thrive on.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Paleo Food Guidelines',
      content: `Eat freely: Grass-fed meats, wild-caught fish, eggs, vegetables (except white potatoes initially), 
      fruits (especially berries), nuts (except peanuts), seeds, healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, avocado).
      Avoid: All grains, legumes, dairy, processed sugar, vegetable oils, artificial ingredients.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Starting Paleo',
      content: `Week 1: Clean out pantry, remove non-paleo foods. Focus on simple meals.
      Week 2-3: Experiment with new vegetables and cooking methods.
      Week 4: Energy stabilizing, cravings reducing, inflammation decreasing.
      Month 2+: Noticeable improvements in digestion, skin, energy, and body composition.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Meal Structure',
      content: `Build meals around: 4-6oz quality protein, 2-3 cups non-starchy vegetables, 
      1-2 thumbs of healthy fat, optional serving of fruit. No need to count calories initially - 
      focus on food quality and eating to satiety. Natural portion control often emerges.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Paleo Carb Cycling',
      content: `Match carbs to activity: Higher carb (sweet potatoes, fruit) on training days, 
      lower carb on rest days. Athletes may need 100-200g carbs, sedentary folks 50-100g. 
      Listen to energy levels and adjust. White rice is gray-area for some post-workout.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Nutrient Density Focus',
      content: `Prioritize: Organ meats (liver weekly), bone broth, fermented vegetables, 
      seafood for omega-3s, colorful vegetables for antioxidants. Nose-to-tail eating 
      maximizes nutrition. Quality matters - grass-fed, organic when possible.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Common Mistakes',
      content: `1) Too low carb for activity level - add sweet potatoes, fruit
      2) Not enough fat - leads to constant hunger
      3) Overdoing nuts and nut flours - can cause digestive issues
      4) Forgetting about sleep and stress - lifestyle factors matter
      5) Being too strict - 80/20 approach is sustainable`
    },
    {
      category: 'Paleo Lifestyle',
      content: `Beyond diet: Prioritize sleep (7-9 hours), manage stress (meditation, nature), 
      move naturally (walking, lifting, sprinting), get sunlight, maintain social connections. 
      Paleo is a template for overall health, not just a diet.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Digestive Healing',
      content: `Many experience improved digestion removing grains/legumes. Support with: 
      bone broth for gut lining, fermented foods for probiotics, digestive enzymes if needed. 
      Food order matters - vegetables first, then protein/fat for optimal digestion.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Autoimmune Protocol',
      content: `AIP removes additional foods: nightshades, eggs, nuts, seeds for 30-60 days. 
      Systematic reintroduction identifies triggers. Powerful for autoimmune conditions. 
      Focus on healing foods: bone broth, organ meats, fermented vegetables.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Athletic Performance',
      content: `Paleo athletes thrive with strategic carb timing. Pre-workout: banana or dates. 
      Post-workout: sweet potato, white rice (if tolerated). Adequate calories crucial. 
      Many report better recovery, less inflammation than standard athletic diets.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Social Navigation',
      content: `Restaurant tips: Meat + vegetables, hold the bread/grains, substitute sides. 
      Parties: Eat beforehand, bring a dish, focus on socializing not food. 
      Explain simply: "I feel better avoiding processed foods and grains."`

  commonQuestions: [
    {
      question: "Why no grains or legumes?",
      answer: "They contain anti-nutrients (lectins, phytates) that can impair digestion and nutrient absorption. Many people experience better digestion, energy, and reduced inflammation without them."
    },
    {
      question: "Is paleo expensive?",
      answer: "Can be, but doesn't have to be. Buy in bulk, choose cheaper cuts (ground meat, chicken thighs), frozen vegetables, seasonal produce. Meal prep saves money and time."
    },
    {
      question: "What about calcium without dairy?",
      answer: "Leafy greens, bone-in fish, bone broth, almonds provide calcium. Plus, lower inflammation may mean better calcium utilization. Many report stronger bones on paleo."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do paleo as a vegetarian?",
      answer: "Very challenging since legumes are excluded. Would need to rely heavily on eggs and possibly include some non-paleo foods. Consider pescatarian approach instead."
    },
    {
      question: "How is paleo different from Whole30?",
      answer: "Whole30 is a 30-day strict elimination based on paleo principles. No sweeteners, alcohol, or paleo treats. It's a reset program, while paleo is a long-term lifestyle."
