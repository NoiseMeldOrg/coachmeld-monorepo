      category: 'Low-Carb Fundamentals',
      content: `Low-carb dieting reduces carbohydrate intake to 50-150g daily, focusing on protein, healthy fats, 
      and non-starchy vegetables. This approach stabilizes blood sugar, reduces insulin, and promotes fat burning. 
      More flexible than keto, allowing for some fruits, legumes, and whole grains in moderation.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Carb Ranges',
      content: `Very low-carb: 20-50g (near ketogenic)
      Low-carb: 50-100g (weight loss sweet spot)
      Moderate low-carb: 100-150g (maintenance, active individuals)
      Choose your range based on goals, activity level, and metabolic health. Start lower, increase as needed.`

    {
      category: 'Blood Sugar Management',
      content: `Low-carb excels at blood sugar control. Pair carbs with protein/fat to slow absorption. 
      Test blood glucose to understand your response to different foods. Many reduce or eliminate 
      diabetes medication (with doctor supervision). Focus on glycemic index and load.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Low-Carb Food Choices',
      content: `Prioritize: All meats, fish, eggs, non-starchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, 
      full-fat dairy, berries, avocados. 
      Moderate: Lower-sugar fruits, legumes (small portions), dark chocolate (85%+).
      Avoid: Bread, pasta, rice, sugary foods, most processed foods, sugary drinks.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Sustainable Weight Loss',
      content: `Low-carb promotes satiety through protein and fat. Natural calorie reduction often occurs. 
      Expect quick initial water weight loss (3-5 lbs), then steady fat loss (1-2 lbs/week). 
      Don't slash calories too low - maintain moderate deficit for hormonal health.`

    {
      category: 'Meal Planning Strategy',
      content: `Base meals on: Palm-sized protein, 2-3 cups vegetables, healthy fat serving. 
      Breakfast: Eggs with vegetables and avocado
      Lunch: Large salad with protein and olive oil
      Dinner: Meat/fish with roasted vegetables and butter
      Snacks: Nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs if needed`
    },
    {
      category: 'Carb Timing',
      content: `Strategic carb placement: Post-workout for recovery, evening for better sleep. 
      Some do better with carbs spread throughout day, others prefer saving for one meal. 
      Match carbs to activity - more on training days, less on rest days.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Common Pitfalls',
      content: `1) Hidden carbs in sauces, dressings, processed foods
      2) Too much fruit or "low-carb" products
      3) Not enough vegetables - aim for variety and volume
      4) Insufficient fat leading to hunger
      5) All-or-nothing mentality - flexibility prevents burnout`

      category: 'Low-Carb Benefits',
      content: `Reported benefits: Stable energy, reduced cravings, better mental clarity, 
      improved triglycerides and HDL, lower blood pressure, reduced inflammation, 
      better skin, improved PCOS symptoms, easier weight maintenance.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Exercise Considerations',
      content: `Most activities fine on low-carb after adaptation (2-4 weeks). 
      For intense training: Add 15-30g carbs pre/post workout. 
      Endurance athletes may need 100-150g on training days. 
      Strength training benefits from some carbs for muscle glycogen.`

      category: 'Social Strategies',
      content: `Restaurants: Substitute sides for vegetables, bunless burgers, salads with protein. 
      Parties: Eat beforehand, focus on meat/cheese/vegetables.

      Be confident in your choices without preaching.`

    {
      category: 'Long-term Success',
      content: `Find your personal carb tolerance through experimentation. 
      Some maintain on 50g, others need 150g. Use measurements beyond scale: 
      energy, mood, bloodwork, body composition. Allow flexibility for special occasions 
      while maintaining overall consistency.`
