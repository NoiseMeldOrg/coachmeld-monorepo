    {
      category: 'Core Principles',
      content: `The carnivore diet consists of eating only animal products - meat, fish, eggs, and some dairy. 
      All plant foods are eliminated. This is the ultimate elimination diet that can help identify food sensitivities 
      and reduce inflammation. Focus on ruminant meats (beef, lamb, bison) as your primary food source.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Getting Started',
      content: `Start with simple meals: ribeye steak, ground beef, eggs, and butter. Salt your food to taste - 
      sodium is crucial on carnivore. Expect an adaptation period of 2-4 weeks where you may feel tired or have 
      digestive changes. This is normal as your body switches to using fat as primary fuel.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Meal Timing',
      content: `Eat when hungry, stop when full. Many carnivores naturally fall into 1-2 meals per day. 
      There's no need to force intermittent fasting - it often happens naturally as your hunger hormones regulate. 
      Listen to your body's signals rather than eating by the clock.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Fat to Protein Ratio',
      content: `Aim for approximately 70-80% of calories from fat, 20-30% from protein. This typically means 
      choosing fattier cuts like ribeye, chuck roast, 80/20 ground beef, and adding butter or tallow if needed. 
      Too much lean protein without adequate fat can cause fatigue and digestive issues.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Electrolytes',
      content: `Salt liberally - aim for 5-10g of sodium daily. Many carnivores use Redmond Real Salt or 
      similar unrefined salts. Magnesium (200-400mg) and potassium can help with adaptation. Bone broth 
      provides natural electrolytes and minerals.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Common Mistakes',
      content: `1) Not eating enough fat - leads to protein poisoning symptoms
      2) Not salting food enough - causes fatigue and headaches
      3) Drinking too much water - dilutes electrolytes
      4) Giving up too early during adaptation
      5) Eating too lean or too much chicken/pork initially`
    },
    {
      category: 'Food Quality',
      content: `Prioritize grass-fed, grass-finished beef when possible, but grain-fed is perfectly acceptable. 
      Organs like liver (small amounts 1-2x/week) provide nutrients. Fresh meat is ideal, but frozen is fine. 
      Avoid processed meats with additives, sugar, or fillers.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Dairy Considerations',
      content: `Some include dairy (butter, heavy cream, hard cheeses), others don't. Start without dairy 
      for 30 days, then reintroduce if desired. Many find they feel better without it. If including dairy, 
      choose full-fat, low-lactose options.`

    {
      category: 'Adaptation Symptoms',
      content: `Week 1-2: Fatigue, headaches, digestive changes, bad breath
      Week 3-4: Energy stabilizing, mental clarity improving
      Month 2+: Stable energy, reduced hunger, improved body composition
      Stay consistent and trust the process.`

    {
      category: 'Benefits Timeline',
      content: `Days 1-7: Reduced bloating, better sleep
      Weeks 2-4: Mental clarity, stable mood, reduced inflammation
      Months 1-3: Weight normalization, skin improvements, joint pain relief
      Months 3+: Optimal body composition, sustained energy, metabolic healing`

      category: 'Shopping List',
      content: `Essentials: Ribeye, NY strip, ground beef (80/20), eggs, butter, salt
      Options: Lamb, bison, beef liver, bone marrow, tallow, ghee
      Seafood: Salmon, sardines, oysters (if tolerated)
      Avoid: Any plant foods, seasonings beyond salt, sauces with sugar`

    {
      category: 'Troubleshooting',
      content: `Constipation: More fat, less protein, adequate salt, consider magnesium
      Diarrhea: May be too much fat initially, temporary adaptation
      Fatigue: Need more fat, check electrolytes, ensure eating enough
      Cravings: Usually pass within 2-4 weeks, eat more fat`

  commonQuestions: [
    {
      question: "How much should I eat?",
      answer: "Eat to satiety. Most people need 1.5-2.5 lbs of meat per day, but this varies. Trust your hunger signals - they become very accurate on carnivore."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need supplements?",
      answer: "Most nutrients come from meat. Consider vitamin D if not getting sun, and magnesium during adaptation. Organ meats provide most vitamins."
    },
    {
      question: "What about vitamin C?",
      answer: "Fresh meat contains enough vitamin C. The need is lower without carbs. No carnivore gets scurvy eating fresh meat."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I have coffee?",
      answer: "Technically not carnivore, but many include black coffee. Try 30 days without to see how you feel."
    },
    {
      question: "What about fiber?",
      answer: "Fiber isn't necessary. Many report better digestion without it. Your gut adapts to efficiently process meat."
