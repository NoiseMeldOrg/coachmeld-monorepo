      content: `Ketovore combines carnivore's animal-food focus with keto's metabolic benefits. 
      80-90% calories from animal products, 10-20% from select low-carb plants. This hybrid approach 
      offers carnivore's simplicity and nutrient density with keto's flexibility for sustainability 
      and social situations.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Food Framework',
      content: `Foundation: All meats, fish, eggs, animal fats (80-90% of diet)
      Allowed plants: Low-carb vegetables, avocados, olives, select nuts
      Limited: Berries, high-fat dairy, coconut products
      Avoid: Grains, legumes, sugar, seed oils, high-carb vegetables
      Stay under 20-30g net carbs for ketosis.`

    {
      category: 'Why Ketovore Works',
      content: `Combines benefits: Carnivore's elimination of plant toxins and anti-nutrients with 
      keto's metabolic flexibility. Easier socially than pure carnivore, more nutrient-dense than 
      standard keto. Great for those who feel best mostly carnivore but want some variety.`

    {
      category: 'Transitioning to Ketovore',
      content: `From Carnivore: Slowly add one plant food at a time, monitor response
      From Keto: Increase animal foods to 80%+, reduce plant variety
      From SAD: Consider 30 days carnivore first, then add select plants
      Track how each food makes you feel - energy, digestion, inflammation.`

    {
      category: 'Meal Structure',
      content: `Typical day: 
      Morning: Eggs cooked in tallow with side of bacon
      Lunch: Ribeye steak with small avocado
      Dinner: Ground beef with saut√©ed mushrooms in butter
      Focus on fatty cuts, add plant foods as condiments not main dishes.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Plant Food Strategy',
      content: `Best tolerated: Avocados, olives, cucumbers, lettuce, mushrooms
      Use sparingly: Broccoli, cauliflower, spinach (watch oxalates)
      Preparation matters: Cook vegetables in animal fat, ferment when possible
      If symptoms return, remove plant foods temporarily.`

    {
      category: 'Ketosis on Ketovore',
      content: `Maintaining ketosis easier with mostly animal foods. Fat naturally high, protein moderate. 
      Test ketones if desired - aim for 0.5-2.0 mmol/L. Many find deeper ketosis than standard keto 
      due to very low carb intake and absence of plant-based sweeteners.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Common Patterns',
      content: `Many ketovores cycle: Stricter (more carnivore) during healing phases, 
      more plants during maintenance or social seasons. Some do carnivore weekdays, 
      ketovore weekends. Find your rhythm based on goals and how you feel.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Digestive Optimization',
      content: `Animal foods digest easily, selected plants add fiber for those who need it. 
      Start with well-cooked vegetables, raw later if tolerated. Apple cider vinegar or 
      digestive enzymes help some. Fermented foods (sauerkraut) can aid transition.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Performance Benefits',
      content: `Athletes report excellent results: stable energy from ketosis, optimal protein for recovery, 
      strategic plants for micronutrients. Some add white rice or fruit around intense training. 
      Most find improved endurance and recovery versus standard diets.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Troubleshooting',
      content: `Bloating/gas: Remove problematic plants, stick to easily digested options
      Low energy: Increase fat, check electrolytes, ensure eating enough
      Not in ketosis: Hidden carbs in vegetables, too much protein
      Cravings: Usually need more fat, may indicate specific nutrient need`
    },
    {
      category: 'Long-term Sustainability',
      content: `Ketovore offers sustainable middle ground. Nutrient density of animal foods prevents 
      deficiencies, plant variety prevents boredom. Social flexibility makes adherence easier. 
      Many report this as their "forever diet" after trying stricter approaches.`

  commonQuestions: [
    {
      question: "How is ketovore different from keto?",
      answer: "Ketovore is 80-90% animal-based, while keto can be plant-heavy. This means better nutrient density, fewer plant toxins, and often easier digestion while maintaining ketosis."
    },
    {
      question: "Which vegetables are best on ketovore?",
      answer: "Low-toxin, low-carb options: avocados, olives, cucumbers, lettuces, mushrooms. Avoid nightshades and high-oxalate greens if sensitive. Always prepare with animal fats."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I have dairy on ketovore?",
      answer: "Yes, but quality matters. Choose full-fat, grass-fed options. Many limit to butter and hard cheeses. If weight loss stalls or inflammation occurs, try removing dairy."
    },
    {
      question: "Is ketovore good for autoimmune conditions?",
      answer: "Many report improvements due to elimination of plant toxins while maintaining variety. Can be stepping stone from strict carnivore to more sustainable long-term approach."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if a plant food bothers me?",
      answer: "Remove all plants for 2-4 weeks, then reintroduce one at a time. Watch for bloating, joint pain, skin issues, energy changes. Keep a food journal to identify patterns."
