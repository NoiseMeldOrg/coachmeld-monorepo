      category: 'Ketogenic Basics',
      content: `The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate-protein, very low-carb approach that shifts your body 
      into ketosis - burning fat for fuel instead of glucose. Typical macros: 70-75% fat, 20-25% protein, 
      5-10% carbs (under 20-30g net carbs daily). This metabolic state offers unique benefits for brain health, 
      weight loss, and metabolic disorders.`

    {
      category: 'Getting Into Ketosis',
      content: `Reaching ketosis typically takes 2-4 days of strict carb restriction. Start by eliminating all 
      sugars, grains, and starches. Focus on fatty meats, fish, eggs, high-fat dairy, nuts, seeds, and 
      low-carb vegetables. Use ketone test strips or blood meter to confirm you're in ketosis (0.5-3.0 mmol/L).`
    },
    {
      category: 'Macro Calculation',
      content: `Calculate your macros: 0.7-1g protein per lb lean body mass, 20-30g net carbs maximum, 
      fill the rest with fat to meet calorie needs. Use apps like Cronometer or Carb Manager to track. 
      Net carbs = total carbs - fiber. Don't fear fat - it's your primary fuel source.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Keto Food List',
      content: `Proteins: Beef, pork, lamb, chicken thighs, fatty fish, eggs
      Fats: Butter, olive oil, coconut oil, MCT oil, avocado oil, tallow
      Low-carb veggies: Spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, asparagus
      Dairy: Heavy cream, full-fat cheese, Greek yogurt (small amounts)
      Nuts/seeds: Macadamias, pecans, walnuts, chia, flax`

    {
      category: 'Keto Flu Prevention',
      content: `The "keto flu" is temporary but preventable. Supplement electrolytes: 5000mg sodium, 
      1000mg potassium, 300mg magnesium daily. Drink bone broth, salt your food liberally, and consider 
      pickle juice for quick sodium. Most symptoms resolve within a week with proper electrolyte management.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Common Keto Mistakes',
      content: `1) Too much protein - excess converts to glucose via gluconeogenesis
      2) Not enough fat - leads to hunger and low energy
      3) Hidden carbs in sauces, seasonings, and "keto" products
      4) Inadequate electrolytes causing fatigue and headaches
      5) Eating too many nuts or dairy which can stall weight loss`

      category: 'Fat Adaptation Timeline',
      content: `Week 1-2: Initial water weight loss, keto flu possible, energy fluctuations
      Week 3-4: Steady energy emerging, mental clarity improving
      Week 5-8: Fat adaptation progressing, endurance improving
      Month 3+: Fully fat adapted, metabolic flexibility, effortless fasting`
    },
    {
      category: 'Intermittent Fasting',
      content: `Keto pairs perfectly with IF. Start with 16:8, progress to 18:6 or OMAD if desired. 
      Fat adaptation makes fasting easier - stable blood sugar means no crashes. Black coffee, tea, 
      and water during fasting window. Break fast with fat and protein, not carbs.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Keto for Weight Loss',
      content: `Create moderate caloric deficit (15-20%). Prioritize protein to preserve muscle. 
      Consider fat fasting (90% fat) to break plateaus. Track measurements, not just weight. 
      Some retain water during fat cell emptying - trust the process. Refeed days can help with hormones.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Testing and Tracking',
      content: `Blood ketones: Most accurate, aim for 0.5-3.0 mmol/L for nutritional ketosis
      Urine strips: Good for beginners, less accurate over time
      Breath meters: Convenient, measures acetone
      Track how you feel - energy, mental clarity, hunger are best indicators`
    },
    {
      category: 'Exercise on Keto',
      content: `Endurance improves once fat-adapted. Strength may dip initially but returns. 
      For high-intensity: Consider targeted keto (15-30g carbs around workout).
      Electrolytes crucial for performance. MCT oil pre-workout for quick energy.
      Allow 4-6 weeks adaptation before judging athletic performance.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Troubleshooting',
      content: `Not losing weight: Check calories, hidden carbs, dairy/nut intake, stress, sleep
      Low energy: More fat, check electrolytes, ensure eating enough
      Digestive issues: Gradually increase fat, digestive enzymes may help
      Bad breath: Normal acetone production, improves with time`

  commonQuestions: [
    {
      question: "Can I have cheat days on keto?",
      answer: "Cheat days kick you out of ketosis and restart adaptation. Better to increase calories with keto foods if needed. For special occasions, plan ahead and get back on track immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "What are net carbs vs total carbs?",
      answer: "Net carbs = total carbs - fiber - sugar alcohols (if applicable). Fiber doesn't impact blood sugar. Count net carbs for keto, staying under 20-30g daily."
    },
    {
      question: "Is keto safe long-term?",
      answer: "Many thrive on keto for years. Regular blood work recommended. Some cycle in and out seasonally. Listen to your body and work with a knowledgeable practitioner."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between keto and low-carb?",
      answer: "Keto aims for ketosis with very low carbs (under 30g). Low-carb is more flexible (50-150g carbs). Keto offers unique metabolic benefits but is more restrictive."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I drink alcohol on keto?",
      answer: "Dry wines and spirits (vodka, whiskey) in moderation. No beer or sweet drinks. Alcohol pauses ketosis and you may get drunk faster. Always account for carbs."
