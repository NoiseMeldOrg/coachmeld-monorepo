      category: 'Advanced Optimization',
      content: `Beyond basic carnivore, optimization involves cycling protein/fat ratios, strategic organ consumption, 
      and understanding your individual response to different animal foods. Track biomarkers like CAC score, 
      ApoB, fasting insulin, and inflammatory markers to fine-tune your approach.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Metabolic Flexibility',
      content: `After 6+ months adapted, experiment with protein cycling: higher protein (35-40%) on training days, 
      higher fat (80-85%) on rest days. This can optimize muscle growth while maintaining metabolic benefits. 
      Monitor ketones and glucose to understand your metabolic state.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Performance Optimization',
      content: `For athletes: Time protein intake around training, 1g/lb lean mass minimum. Consider raw dairy 
      post-workout if tolerated. Creatine and salt pre-workout. Bone broth for recovery. Some thrive on 
      higher protein ratios (PKD style) for performance.`

    {
      category: 'Nutrient Density Strategy',
      content: `Weekly rotation: 2-4oz liver, heart, kidney, or other organs. Bone marrow 2-3x/week. 
      Oysters for zinc and copper. Egg yolks for choline. Grass-finished fat for K2. This provides 
      comprehensive nutrition without supplements.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Healing Protocols',
      content: `Autoimmune: Strict beef, salt, water for 30-90 days minimum. 
      Gut healing: Bone broth, gelatin, avoid dairy and eggs initially.
      Mental health: Higher fat ratio (80%+), consistent meal timing.
      Weight loss: Moderate protein, high fat, OMAD often works well.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Advanced Troubleshooting',
      content: `Histamine issues: Fresh meat only, avoid aged/cured meats, consider DAO enzyme
      Oxalate dumping: Gradual transition, vitamin B6, magnesium support
      Thyroid concerns: Ensure adequate calories, check reverse T3
      Hormone optimization: Test and adjust fat/protein for optimal testosterone/estrogen`

    {
      category: 'Sourcing Excellence',
      content: `Build relationships with local farmers. Buy whole animal shares for cost savings. 
      Best sources: White Oak Pastures, Belcampo, US Wellness Meats, local regenerative farms. 
      Learn to appreciate all cuts - organs, bones, fat trimmings have unique benefits.`
    },
    {
      category: 'Lab Work Guidelines',
      content: `Essential tests: Fasting insulin (<5), triglycerides (<70), HDL (>60), 
      CAC score, inflammatory markers (CRP, homocysteine). 
      Optimal ranges differ on carnivore - LDL may be higher but particle size improves.`

    {
      category: 'Female Considerations',
      content: `Hormonal cycling: Some women need more carbs during luteal phase - consider raw honey/dairy.
      Pregnancy: Work with knowledgeable practitioner, may need more variety.
      Menopause: Higher fat often helps with symptoms, consistent meal timing important.`

      category: 'Long-term Sustainability',
      content: `Year 1: Strict healing phase
      Year 2+: Find your personal template - some thrive on beef only, others include seafood, eggs, dairy
      Social situations: Plan ahead, eat before events, bring your own food
      Travel: Steakhouses everywhere, pack pemmican/biltong`

      category: 'Cooking Mastery',
      content: `Reverse sear for perfect steaks: 275°F oven then high-heat sear
      Slow cook tough cuts: Chuck roast at 200°F for 8 hours melts collagen
      Render your own tallow for cooking and skin care
      Make bone broth weekly - 24-48 hour simmer for maximum nutrients`

  commonQuestions: [
    {
      question: "How do I break a weight loss plateau?",
      answer: "Try fat fasting (80-90% fat) for 3-5 days, implement OMAD, check for hidden stressors, ensure adequate sleep, or paradoxically eat more for a few days to reset metabolism."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I track macros?",
      answer: "Initially helpful to ensure adequate fat. Long-term, appetite regulation is superior. Track if: optimizing performance, breaking plateau, or troubleshooting issues."
    },
    {
      question: "What about carnivore for kids?",
      answer: "Many thrive, but work with knowledgeable practitioner. Kids often need more frequent meals, may include some fruit/honey. Focus on nutrient density."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I handle social pressure?",
      answer: "Be confident but not preachy. Say 'I feel best eating this way' rather than debating. Bring epic steaks to gatherings. Results speak louder than arguments."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I build muscle on carnivore?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Many report better gains due to optimal hormones. Ensure adequate protein (1g/lb+), train heavy, prioritize sleep. Some add raw dairy or honey around workouts."
